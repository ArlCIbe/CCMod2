      <h4>DATA TYPES - built-in data structures</h4>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0%;">
         [STRING] - sequence of text enclosed in single or double quote marks <br>
         [NUMBER] - number; no quote marks <br>
         [BOOLEAN] - true or false value; no quote marks <br>
         [ARRAY] - allows you to store multiple values (<strong>NOTE:</strong> refer to each member of the array like this: myVariable[0], myVariable[1], etc.) 
      </p>

      <p style="color: red; margin: 0% 0% 0% 0%;">
         [OBJECTS] - EVERYTHING IN JS IS AN OBJECT AND CAN BE STORED AS A VARIABLE
      </p>

      <!-- EXPRESSIONS - any valid piece of code that resolves to a value (IOW when computer is done doing what it needs to do, a value is produced); comprised of OPERATORS and OPERANDS -->
<!-- 
      OPERANDS - part of expression that represents the data being manipulated by the operator (like a noun in a sentence)

      <h3>OPERATORS - mathematical symbol used to execute operations on OPERANDS (like a verb in a sentence)</h3> -->

         <!-- <h4>ARITHMETIC - operands take numerical values (literals or variables) and return a single numerical value</h4>
         
         <p>
            [ADDITION | SUBTRACTION | MULTIPLICATION | DIVISION | EXPONENTIATION] - { + | - | * | / | ** } <br>
             [MODULUS/REMAINDER] - returns the remainder after the first operand is divided by the second operand { % } <br>
            [INCREMENT] -  adds 1. returns the value from BEFORE the increment if placed AFTER the operand and returna the value from AFTER the increment if placed BEFORE the operand { ++ } <br>
            [DECREMENT] - subtracts 1. returns the value from BEFORE the increment if placed AFTER the operand and returna the value from AFTER the increment if placed BEFORE the operand { -- } <br>
         </p>

         <h4>ASSIGNMENT - "assigns" value to left operand based on value of right operand { = }</h4>

         <p>
            [ADDITION | SUBTRACTION | MULTIPLICATION | DIVISION | EXPONENTIATION | MODULUS/REMAINDER | LEFT SHIFT | RIGHT SHIFT] - performs operation on operands and assigns the result to the left operand { += | -= | *= | /= | **= | %= | <<= | >>= }
            
         </p>

         <h5 style="color: red;">BITWISE - treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones)</h5>

         <P style="color: red;">
            [AND] - <br>
            [OR] - <br>
            [XOR] - <br>
            [LEFT SHIFT] - <br>
            [RIGHT SHIFT] - <br>
            [UNSIGNED RIGHT SHIFT] - <br>
         </P>

         <h4>COMPARISON - compares operands (can be numerical, string, logical, or object values) and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true</h4>

         <p>
            [EQUAL] - 	tests if operands are equal; returns true or false value { == } <br>
            [NOT EQUAL] - tests whether or not two values are NOT equal { != } <br>
            [STRICT EQUAL] - tests if operands are equal AND of the same data type; returns true or false value { === } <br>
            [STRICT NOT EQUAL] - tests if operands are of the same type but not equal OR are of different type; returns true or false value { !== } <br>
            [GREATER THAN | GREATER THAN OR EQUAL | LESS THAN | LESS THAN OR EQUAL] - { > | >= | < | <= }
         </p>

         [NOT] -  returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes { ! } <br> 

      VARIABLES - containers that store values <br>

      IDENTIFIER - actual name given to the variable <br>
      
      <h4>VARIABLE DECLARATIONS - keywords used to declare variables</h4>

      <p style="color: red;">
         [let] - Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value <br>
         [const] - Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant <br>
         [var] - Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value <br>
      </p>

      
      <h3>FUNCTION - way to package functionality that you want to reuse throughout your code (<strong>HINT:</strong> if you see something that looks like a variable name followed by parentheses, it's probably a function)</h3>
      
      <p>
         [ANONYMOUS] - unnamed funtion; <strong>function ()</strong> <br>
         [ARROW] - alternate way to write an anonymous function; <strong>() =></strong> <br>
      </p>

      <p>
         ARGUMENTS - actual value passed as input to a function when it is called; placed inside parentheses and separated by commas if there's more than one <br>

         PARAMETERS - named variable passed into a function's definition; placed inside parentheses and separated by commas if there's more than one <br>

         <strong>PARAMETERS VS ARGUMENTS</strong> - PARAMETERS are placeholders: they define the type and name of the value that will be passed into the function. ARGUMENTS are the <i>concrete</i> value assigned to a parameter
      </p>

      <h4>SCOPE - the region where variables, objects, and functions can be referenced</h4>

      <p>
         [GLOBAL] - variables, objects, and functions anywhere inside a program
         [FILE/MODULE] - variables, objects, and functions inside a specific file
         [FUNCTION] - variables, objects, and functions inside functions
         [BLOCK] - variables, objects, and functions inside curly braces
      </p>

      STATEMENT - line of code commanding a task in a computer programming language (every program is just a sequence of statements)

      <h4>CONDITIONAL - used to test if an expression returns true or not</h4>

      <p>
         [IF...ELSE]
      </p>

      <p style="color: red;">METHOD - </p>

      EVENT HANDLERS - code structures that listen for activity in the browser and then run code in response

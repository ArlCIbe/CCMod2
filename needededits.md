# ALL

## review info and make necessary edits to clearly communicate concepts

## explain examples

## add links to good sources

# INTRO

## add examples from the line where statements are defined on down

# EXPRESSIONS

## edit markdown

# FUNCTIONS

## (reowrd this)
#### wrapping them in () prevents collisions between identifiers and controls visibility of member functions

## add scope definition/explanation

### reword in a way that explains this more clearly: namespsace -  conceptual container that provides scope to identifiers; used to prevent collisions between them

## edit markdown

# OBJECTS

## edit markdown

## add info about string escape characters

## add info about breaking up characters, particularly string addition

## add info about strings as objects (`new`)

## explain examples

## condense and add this info: 

object initializers:

- comma-delimited list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in {}
- using Object.create()
- invoking a constructor function with the new operator.

functions are first-class objects, because they can be passed to other functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables and properties. They can also have properties and methods just like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be called

Class versus object

A class is a template for objects. A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class.

What is class or object in JavaScript?

Objects are more flexible and can be modified dynamically by adding or removing properties and methods at runtime. In summary, classes provide a more formal and organised way of defining objects and their behavior, while objects offer more flexibility and dynamic capabilities.

What is a class in programming?

In object-oriented programming, a class is a template definition of the methods and variables in a particular kind of object. Thus, an object is a specific instance of a class; it contains real values instead of variables. The class is one of the defining ideas of object-oriented programming.

# EVENTS

## reoword: HTML allows event handler attributes with JS code

# OLD NOTES:

## review and make sure I pull any info that I have not already covered elsewhere and add to appropriate files

Parameters: Variables in a method definition that specify what kind of data the method can receive.
Arguments: Actual values supplied to the method when it is called.
